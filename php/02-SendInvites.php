Exercise: Create a PHP script that automates the process of sending personalized email invitations to a list of recipients stored in a CSV file.

Instructions:

    1. Create a CSV file named recipients.csv with the following columns: Name and Email. Populate this file with the names and email addresses of the recipients.
    2. Write a PHP script named send_invitations.php that reads the recipients.csv file, composes personalized email invitations, and sends them to each recipient using PHP's mail() function or a library like PHPMailer.
    3. The email invitations should include a personalized greeting addressing each recipient by name.
    4. Test the script by running it from the command line or accessing it via a web browser.
    5. Handle any errors gracefully and log them to a file for later review.
