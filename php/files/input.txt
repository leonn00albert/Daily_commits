Cooking Tirmis (Lupini Beans) in the style of Tolstoy involves a hearty and rustic preparation that aligns with the simplicity often associated with Tolstoy's era. Here's a recipe:

Ingredients:

    2 cups dried tirmis (lupini beans)
    Water for soaking and cooking
    Salt to taste
    2-3 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)

Instructions:

    Soaking the Tirmis: Place the dried tirmis in a large bowl and cover them with plenty of water. Soak them overnight or for at least 12 hours. This process helps to soften the beans and reduce cooking time.

    Boiling the Tirmis: After soaking, drain the tirmis and rinse them under cold water. Transfer them to a large pot and cover them with fresh water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let the beans simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are tender. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface during cooking.

    Seasoning: In a separate skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant and golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.

    Combining: Once the tirmis are cooked, drain them and transfer them to a serving dish. Pour the garlic-infused olive oil over the cooked beans. Sprinkle with salt to taste and gently toss to coat the beans evenly with the seasoned oil.

    Garnish: If desired, sprinkle the cooked tirmis with freshly chopped parsley for added flavor and presentation.

    Serving: Serve the Tolstoy-style tirmis warm as a side dish or as part of a larger meal. They pair well with rustic bread, roasted vegetables, or grilled meats.

This simple and wholesome dish embodies the rustic charm and straightforwardness often associated with Tolstoy's approach to life and literature. Enjoy!
